# Project Brief – _Asteroids: Neon Shards_

## 1. Project Overview

**Working Title:** _Asteroids: Neon Shards_  
**Description (One-Liner):** A vaporwave-inspired roguelite reimagining of Asteroids, where players blast neon asteroids to collect shards that persist across runs.  
**Core Vision:** Deliver a complete, fun, and replayable game that validates the BMAD method by starting with a simple Asteroids clone, enhancing it with unique aesthetic flair, and extending replayability through roguelite progression.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Complete a full game** – prove the BMAD method works end-to-end with a shipped product.
2. **Ensure replayability** – integrate roguelite progression (Neon Shards) so the game remains engaging beyond initial play.
3. **Prioritize fun & motivation** – make gameplay enjoyable to prevent project fatigue and maintain external appeal.

**Secondary Objectives:**

- Test BMAD’s story-driven workflow under real-world constraints.
- Develop lightweight but unique vaporwave aesthetic to differentiate the game.
- Establish a foundation codebase (Phaser 3 + TypeScript) for potential future expansions.

## 3. Target Audience

**Primary Audience:**

- Indie game enthusiasts who enjoy retro arcade experiences with a modern twist.
- Roguelite fans looking for quick, replayable sessions with meaningful progression.
- Casual to mid-core players who want short, satisfying play sessions (5–15 minutes per run).

**Secondary Audience:**

- Game dev learners & peers following the BMAD method as a proof-of-concept case study.
- Retro/arcade nostalgia players drawn to Asteroids’ classic loop but curious about fresh takes.
- Vaporwave/retro-futurism fans attracted by the game’s unique aesthetic style.

**Audience Needs & Motivations:**

- Fast-paced, easy-to-pick-up gameplay.
- Replay value through upgrades and progression.
- Distinctive style that feels fun and “share-worthy.”

## 4. Key Features & Scope

**Core Features (MVP):**

1. Asteroids Clone Base – classic movement, shooting, and asteroid destruction.
2. Neon Shards – collectible currency dropped from asteroids.
3. Vaporwave Aesthetic Layer – vibrant color palette, retro-futuristic visuals, and synthwave soundtrack.

**Extended Features (Post-MVP):**

1. Roguelite Progression – shard-based meta-upgrades (fuel, shields, weapons).
2. Dynamic Asteroid Types – normal, glowing (temporary boosts), corrupted (high risk/reward).

**Scope Boundaries (Not Included in Initial Release):**

- Mid-Run Shops/Stations (stylized vaporwave hubs for temporary upgrades)
- Chain Reaction System (skill-based shard multipliers for destruction combos)
- Online multiplayer or co-op
- Procedurally generated levels beyond asteroid waves
- Narrative or lore-heavy content
- Extensive customization systems

## 5. Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**

- Core gameplay runs at 60 FPS on desktop and mid-range mobile devices.
- No critical bugs in the Asteroids loop (movement, shooting, collisions).
- Load times under 3 seconds for initial boot.

**Player Experience Metrics:**

- Players complete at least 3 runs per session on average (showing replayability).
- > 80% tutorial completion rate, ensuring accessibility.
- Session length target: 5–15 minutes, matching design intent.

**Project Validation Metrics:**

- Complete MVP delivery (Asteroids Clone Base + Vaporwave Layer).
- Roguelite shard progression successfully implemented post-MVP.
- Demonstrates BMAD method effectiveness for end-to-end delivery.

## 6. Risks & Constraints

**Key Risks:**

1. Scope Creep – temptation to add roguelite systems (shops, chain multipliers) before MVP is finished.
2. Balancing Roguelite Progression – risk of upgrades feeling either trivial or overpowering, reducing replayability.
3. Aesthetic Clarity – vaporwave visuals and effects could reduce readability during fast gameplay.
4. Motivation Drop-Off – if fun factor is not maintained, project completion is at risk.

**Constraints:**

- Technology: Phaser 3 + TypeScript (strict mode); must meet 60 FPS target.
- Team: Small-scale (AI + user collaboration), so scope must remain lean.
- Time: MVP targeted for 1–2 week sprint; roguelite layer post-MVP.
- Assets: Limited to affordable or generated art/audio; custom asset creation adds risk.

## 7. Next Steps & Timeline

**Immediate Actions (Week 1–2):**

- Set up Phaser 3 + TypeScript project boilerplate.
- Implement Asteroids Clone Base: player movement, shooting, collisions, basic asteroid waves.
- Add placeholder assets and basic UI.

**Short-Term (Week 3–4):**

- Apply Vaporwave Aesthetic Layer: palette, shaders/filters, synthwave music.
- Polish core loop for smooth gameplay and visual clarity.
- Conduct internal playtesting to validate fun factor.

**Medium-Term (Post-MVP, Weeks 5+):**

- Implement Neon Shards progression system: drops, persistence, upgrade tree.
- Balance upgrade pacing and shard economy.
- Add dynamic asteroid types (normal, glowing, corrupted).

**Long-Term (Future Opportunities):**

- Explore Mid-Run Shops/Stations and Chain Reaction System (if scope allows).
- Expand aesthetic immersion (backgrounds, effects).
- Consider releasing as a polished showcase of BMAD workflow.

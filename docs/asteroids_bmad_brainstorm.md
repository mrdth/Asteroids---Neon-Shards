### Executive Summary

**Topic:** New game idea using BMAD method  
**Session Goals:** Refine initial idea, uncover core motivations, and ensure alignment with BMAD learning goals  
**Techniques Used:** Five Whys, SCAMPER (Substitute & Combine)  
**Total Ideas Generated:** 3 refined progression concepts

**Key Themes Identified:**

- Completing a first project is critical
- Replayability makes even simple games more engaging
- Fun is necessary for motivation and show-worthiness
- BMAD should be tested end-to-end with a complete product
- Roguelite mechanics can be naturally integrated into Asteroidsâ€™ core loop

### Technique Sessions

#### Five Whys â€“ Focused Deep Dive

**Description:** Iteratively asked "why" to uncover root motivations behind the game idea.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. Asteroids clone with vaporwave aesthetics and roguelite progression elements
2. Chosen because itâ€™s simple enough to complete, yet roguelite elements boost replayability
3. Completion is essential to avoid project abandonment
4. A finished product validates BMAD method in practice
5. Fun + replayability ensure both personal motivation and external appeal

**Insights Discovered:**

- The roguelite element isnâ€™t just feature creepâ€”itâ€™s purposeful for engagement and testing BMAD under complexity
- The _true goal_ is not just a game, but proving BMAD works for end-to-end delivery
- Motivation and fun are structural to finishing, not optional extras

**Notable Connections:**

- Replayability = both design challenge and motivational tool
- Vaporwave aesthetic adds personality without increasing scope
- Aligns with BMADâ€™s philosophy: start simple, iterate, finish

#### SCAMPER â€“ Substitute & Combine

**Description:** Explored how to substitute classic Asteroids mechanics with roguelite elements, and then combine them into the core loop.

**Ideas Generated:**

- **Substitute:**
  - Lives â†’ Meta progression (permadeath, persistent upgrades)
  - Score â†’ Neon Shards (persistent currency)
  - Weapons â†’ Unlockable roguelite loadouts
- **Combine:**
  - Asteroid types provide progression: normal = shards, rare glowing = temporary boosts, corrupted = risky but rewarding
  - Fuel & health as dual survival limits, creating tension
  - Chain reactions reward shard multipliers (skill-based rewards)
  - Shards are our currency: spent **between runs** (permanent upgrades)

**Insights Discovered:**

- Roguelite mechanics feel strongest when directly tied to asteroid destruction
- Fuel economy layered with shard gain creates a natural risk/reward loop

**Notable Connections:**

- Replayability is reinforced by both skill expression (chain multipliers) and meta progression (shards)
- Vaporwave stations could be stylized mid-run shops, further supporting the aesthetic

### Idea Categorization

**Immediate Opportunities:**

1. **Asteroids Clone Base**
   - Description: Core mechanic with shooting and asteroid destruction
   - Why immediate: Simple, proven, easy to implement
   - Resources needed: Phaser 3 setup, basic art, input handling

**Future Innovations:**

1. **Roguelite Progression with Neon Shards**
   - Description: Currency system with meta-progression upgrades (fuel, health, weapons, shields)
   - Development needed: Currency collection, persistence system, upgrade tree
   - Timeline estimate: After core loop is polished

**Moonshots:**

1. **Fully Stylized Vaporwave World**
   - Description: Aesthetic immersion with music, neon visuals, and retro-future vibe
   - Transformative potential: Distinguishes the game, creates unique identity
   - Challenges: Asset creation, maintaining readability with strong visuals

**Insights & Learnings:**

- A minimal but complete Asteroids clone is step one
- Replayability adds both design depth and motivational pull
- Fun is the safeguard against project fatigue
- Roguelite mechanics should be tightly bound to asteroid destruction, not bolted on

### Action Planning

**Top 3 Priority Ideas:**

**#1 Priority: Asteroids Clone Base**

- Rationale: Foundation for all further work, simplest path to finished product
- Next steps: Build core loop (movement, shooting, collisions)
- Resources needed: Phaser 3 + TypeScript boilerplate, placeholder assets
- Timeline: Short sprint (1â€“2 weeks)

**#2 Priority: Vaporwave Aesthetic Layer**

- Rationale: Adds uniqueness without scope bloat
- Next steps: Define visual palette, pick music, apply shader/filters
- Resources needed: Art direction, sound assets
- Timeline: Parallel with polishing

**#3 Priority: Roguelite Progression (Neon Shards)**

- Rationale: Keeps game fun and replayable while showcasing BMAD method with persistence
- Next steps: Implement shard drops, design upgrade tree, add persistence between runs
- Resources needed: Data storage, balancing framework, shard economy design
- Timeline: After MVP release

### Reflection & Follow-up

- **What Worked Well:** Five Whys clarified real motivations; SCAMPER grounded roguelite features in core gameplay
- **Areas for Exploration:** Which upgrades should be temporary (shops) vs. permanent (meta-progression)
- **Recommended Follow-up Techniques:** Player Perspective Critique, Adapt (borrow roguelite patterns from other games)
- **Questions That Emerged:** How deep should the upgrade system be without risking scope creep?
- **Next Session Planning:** Explore upgrade tiers and pacing in follow-up brainstorm (~1 week)

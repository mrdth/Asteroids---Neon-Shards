# Story: Weapon & Bullets System with Fire Rate Control

**Epic:** Core Game Loop
**Story ID:** CGE-003
**Priority:** High
**Points:** 10
**Status:** Draft

## Description

Implement the player's primary interaction system - a neon laser weapon with controlled fire rate, bullet physics, collision detection, and visual feedback. This system enables players to destroy asteroids through precise shooting mechanics while maintaining game balance through fire rate limitations.

The weapon system includes automatic fire rate capping (3-5 shots/sec), neon laser projectiles with consistent damage (20 per shot), bullet lifetime management, and collision detection with asteroids. The system uses object pooling for performance optimization and provides satisfying visual/audio feedback for each shot fired.

**GDD Reference:** Section 2.1 (Ship Controls) - "Shooting: 3â€“5 shots/sec, neon lasers, limited by fire rate cap" and Section 2.5 (Asteroid Health & Rewards) - "Base Weapon Damage: 20 per shot"

**Architecture Reference:** Section 6.3 (Weapon & Bullets) - "Fire-rate cap enforced; bullet pool with ring buffer. Bullets carry damage: 20 base; lifetime cull"

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code reviewed and follows TypeScript strict mode standards
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>90% coverage for weapon logic)
- [ ] Integration tests passing with PlayerShip and Asteroid systems

## Notes

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use `performance.now()` for high-precision fire rate timing instead of frame-based counters
- Implement bullet physics using `setVelocity()` rather than position manipulation
- Cache trigonometric calculations for muzzle position to optimize performance
- Ensure collision detection occurs before bullet lifetime updates to prevent missed hits

**Design Decisions:**

- Fire rate cap: Prevents weapon from becoming overpowered while maintaining responsiveness
- Object pooling: Essential for performance during rapid firing sequences
- Screen wrapping: Maintains consistency with other game objects and enables trick shots
- Lifetime limitation: Prevents visual clutter and encourages accurate shooting

**Future Considerations:**

- Weapon upgrade system hooks for fire rate, damage, and multi-shot (post-MVP)
- Bullet trail effects and enhanced visual feedback (polish phase)
- Sound variation system for rapid fire sequences (polish phase)
- Bullet penetration and special ammunition types (future expansion)

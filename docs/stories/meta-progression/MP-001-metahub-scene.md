# Story: MetaHub Scene - Upgrade Tree Interface

**Epic:** Meta Progression
**Story ID:** MP-001
**Priority:** High
**Points:** 15
**Status:** New

## Description

Implement the MetaHub Scene that serves as the central progression system, allowing players to spend persistent shards on permanent upgrades that enhance future runs. This scene transforms the roguelite experience by providing meaningful meta-progression through a visually appealing tech-tree interface with branching upgrade paths.

The MetaHub features an interactive upgrade tree with offensive, defensive, and mobility categories, displays current shard balance and upgrade costs, provides detailed upgrade descriptions with stat previews, and maintains visual progress tracking. The interface should feel premium and exciting while being functionally clear for strategic upgrade decisions.

**GDD Reference:** Section 3 (Progression Systems) - "Upgrade Categories: Offense (fire rate, damage, multi-shot). Defense (shields, shard magnet). Mobility (thrust, turn speed, efficiency). Economy: Low-cost early upgrades (5â€“10 shards), exponential growth. Meta Tree: Neon hub screen, branching upgrade paths"

**Architecture Reference:** Section 5 (Scenes & Flow) - "MetaHubScene: upgrade purchase/apply; returns to Menu"

### Integration Points

**Scene Flow Integration:**

- MenuScene: "Upgrades" button transitions to MetaHub Scene
- SummaryScene: "View Upgrades" button transitions to MetaHub Scene
- MetaHub: "Back" button returns to previous scene (Menu or Summary)

**System Dependencies:**

- SaveSystem: Persistent storage for upgrade progress and effect application
- Balance Config: Upgrade effects modify gameplay parameters

## Game Design Context

**GDD Reference:** Section 3 (Progression Systems)

**Game Mechanic:** Meta-progression system that provides permanent advancement and replayability motivation

**Player Experience Goal:** Create meaningful, strategic upgrade decisions that noticeably improve gameplay performance. Each upgrade purchase should feel impactful and create anticipation for testing improvements in the next run.

**Economy Design:**

- **Early Game**: 5-10 shard upgrades provide immediate noticeable improvements
- **Mid Game**: 25-50 shard upgrades offer significant power increases
- **Late Game**: 100+ shard upgrades provide incremental but meaningful optimization
- **Exponential Growth**: Ensures early upgrades remain accessible while late upgrades require dedication

**Upgrade Categories:**

- **Offense**: Fire rate (+0.5/level), damage (+2/level), multi-shot (unlock tiers)
- **Defense**: Shield health (+25/level), shard magnet radius (+10 pixels/level)
- **Mobility**: Thrust (+15/level), turn speed (+10 degrees/level), efficiency (+5%/level)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

**Test Files:**

- `tests/scenes/MetaHubScene.test.ts`
- `tests/ui/UpgradeTree.test.ts`
- `tests/ui/UpgradeNode.test.ts`
- `tests/systems/UpgradeSystem.test.ts`

**Test Scenarios:**

- UpgradeSystem correctly calculates costs with exponential growth
- Prerequisite validation prevents invalid purchases
- Upgrade effects are properly applied to gameplay systems
- Shard balance updates correctly after purchases
- Save system persists upgrade progress reliably
- UI state updates correctly for available/locked/maxed upgrades
- Scene transitions preserve upgrade progress

### Integration Tests

**Manual Test Cases:**

1. **Purchase Flow Test**
   - Expected: Purchase depletes shards, applies effects, updates UI states
   - Performance: Purchase transaction completes within 100ms

2. **Prerequisite System Test**
   - Expected: Locked upgrades become available when prerequisites met
   - Edge Case: Complex prerequisite chains work correctly

3. **Effect Application Test**
   - Expected: Purchased upgrades noticeably improve gameplay performance
   - Performance: Effect application doesn't impact frame rate

4. **Persistence Test**
   - Expected: Upgrades persist across browser sessions and game restarts
   - Edge Case: Save corruption falls back gracefully

### Performance Tests

**Metrics to Verify:**

- MetaHub Scene loads within 300ms from transition
- Upgrade tree interactions maintain 60 FPS with smooth animations
- Purchase transactions complete within 100ms including save operations
- Effect calculations complete within 50ms for complex upgrade combinations

## Dependencies

**Story Dependencies:**

- SI-004: Summary Scene (pending) - Required for SummaryScene â†’ MetaHub transition
- All Core Game Loop stories - Required for upgrade effect application

**Technical Dependencies:**

- Existing SaveSystem for upgrade persistence
- Balance configuration system for effect integration
- Phaser 3 UI components for interactive tree interface

**Asset Dependencies:**

- Upgrade icons: Distinct icons for each upgrade category and type
- Location: `assets/ui/upgrades/offense/`, `defense/`, `mobility/`
- MetaHub background: Tech-tree styled vaporwave background
- Location: `assets/ui/metahub-bg.png`
- Purchase effects: Visual feedback for successful upgrade purchases
- Location: `assets/fx/upgrade-purchased.png`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified through testing
- [ ] Code reviewed and follows TypeScript strict mode standards
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>90% coverage for upgrade logic)
- [ ] Integration tests passing with gameplay systems and save persistence
- [ ] Performance targets met (300ms load, 60 FPS interactions, 100ms purchases)
- [ ] No ESLint warnings or errors in MetaHub system code
- [ ] Upgrade costs follow GDD economy with appropriate exponential growth
- [ ] Prerequisite system works correctly with branching upgrade paths
- [ ] Visual design matches vaporwave aesthetic with clear tech-tree styling
- [ ] Upgrade effects create noticeable gameplay improvements
- [ ] Scene transitions work smoothly from Menu and Summary scenes

## Notes

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use Phaser's built-in interaction system for upgrade node clicking
- Implement upgrade effects as modifiers to balance config rather than direct system changes
- Cache effect calculations to avoid repeated computation during gameplay
- Use object pooling for upgrade node creation to improve performance

**Design Decisions:**

- Exponential cost growth: Maintains early accessibility while creating long-term goals
- Prerequisite system: Creates strategic depth and progression structure
- Effect categories: Clear organization helps players understand upgrade impact
- Visual feedback: Immediate confirmation makes purchases feel satisfying

**Future Considerations:**

- Upgrade refund system for experimentation (post-MVP)
- Advanced upgrade types (set bonuses, conditional effects)
- Upgrade recommendation system for new players
- Achievement integration with upgrade milestones
